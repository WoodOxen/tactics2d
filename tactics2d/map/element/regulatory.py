        This class is still under development. It is supposed to support the detection of traffic events in the future.

    Attributes:
        id_ (str): The id of the regulatory element.
        relations (dict): A dictionary of the relations that the regulatory element belongs to. The key is the id of the relation, and the value is the role of the relation. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
        ways (dict): A dictionary of the ways that the regulatory element belongs to. The key is the id of the way, and the value is the role of the way. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
        nodes (dict): A dictionary of the nodes that the regulatory element belongs to. The key is the id of the node, and the value is the role of the node. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
        type_ (str): The type of the regulatory element. Defaults to "regulatory_element".
        subtype (str): The subtype of the regulatory element.
        position (str): The position of the regulatory element. Defaults to None.
        location (str): The location of the regulatory element. Defaults to None.
        dynamic (bool): Whether the regulatory element is dynamic. Defaults to False.
        fallback (bool): Whether the regulatory element is a fallback. Defaults to False.
        custom_tags (dict): The custom tags of the regulatory element. Defaults to None.
