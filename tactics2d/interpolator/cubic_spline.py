        boundary_type (int): Boundary condition type. The cubic spline interpolator offers three distinct boundary condition options: Natural (1), Clamped (2), and NotAKnot (3). By default, the not-a-knot boundary condition is applied, serving as a wise choice when specific boundary condition information is unavailable.

            Clamped (int): Clamped boundary condition. The first derivative of the curve at the first and the last control points is set to the given values.
            NotAKnot (int): Not-a-knot boundary condition. The first and the second cubic functions are connected at the second and the third control points, and the last and the second-to-last cubic functions are connected at the last and the second-to-last control points.
