## About

Welcome to the official documentation of Python Library tactics2d!

`tactics2d` is an open-source Python library that provides diverse and challenging traffic scenarios for the development and evaluation of reinforcement learning-based decision-making models in autonomous driving. `tactics2d` stands out with the following key features:

- **Compatibility**
  - 📦 Trajectory dataset -- Enables seamless importation of various real-world trajectory datasets, including Argoverse, Dragon Lake Parking (DLP), INTERACTION, LevelX Series (highD, inD, rounD, ExiD), NuPlan, and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), encompassing both trajectory parsing and map information.
  - 📄 Map format -- Enables parsing and conversion of commonly used open map formats like OpenDRIVE, Lanelet2-style OpenStreetMap (OSM), and SUMO roadnet.
- **Customizability**
  - 🚗 Traffic participants -- Supports the creation of new traffic participant classes with customizable physical attributes, physics dynamics/kinematics models, and behavior models.
  - 🚧 Road elements -- Support the definition of new road elements, with a focus on regulatory aspects.
- **Diversity**
  - 🛣️ Traffic scenarios -- Features an extensive range of built-in Gym-style traffic scenarios, including highway, lane-merging, unsignalized/signalized intersection, roundabout, parking, and racing.
  - 🚲 Traffic participants -- Features a variety of built-in traffic participants with realistic physics parameters, detailed further [here](https://tactics2d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/participant/#templates-for-traffic-participants).
  - 📷 Sensors -- Provides bird-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation RGB image and single-line LiDAR point cloud for model input.
- **Visualization** -- Offers a user-friendly visualization tool for real-time rendering of traffic scenarios and participants, along with the capability to record and replay traffic scenarios.
- **Reliability** -- Over 85\% code is covered by unit tests and integration tests.

## Why `tactics2d`?

### Similar Works

`tactics2d` is crafted to offer a robust and intuitive environment tailored for the development and evaluation of autonomous driving decision-making models. As a third-party library, `tactics2d` does not cater to any specific dataset; instead, its focus lies in facilitating parsing, visualization, log replaying, and interactive simulation across a diverse array of datasets and map formats. The table below provides a comparative overview of `tactics2d` alongside other open-source simulators under active maintenance.

### Dataset Compatibility

`tactics2d` excels in parsing various datasets into unified map and traffic participant data structures, enabling seamless integration for both log replay and interactive simulations.

Below is a comparison of dataset support between `tactics2d` and other simulators. `tactics2d` strives to accommodate a wide range of datasets, and we commit to keeping the table updated on a regular basis.

!!! note "TODO"
    We have a plan to add support to the following datasets in the future:

    - NGSIM
    - Lyft 5

Feel free to suggest additional trajectory datasets to be incorporated into our support list by either [opening an issue](https://github.com/WoodOxen/tactics2d/issues) or submitting a pull request. We value community input and are committed to expanding our dataset coverage to better serve our users.
