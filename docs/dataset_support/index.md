# Dataset Support

This page visualizes sample traffic scenarios of every dataset that `Tactics2D` supports. If you want to propose new datasets to be supported by `Tactics2D`, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/WoodOxen/tactics2d/issues).

## HighD

HighD is a dataset collected by Aachen University, German. This dataset "includes post-processed trajectories of 110 000 vehicles including cars and trucks extracted from drone video recordings at German highways around Cologne during 2017 and 2018. At six different locations, 60 recordings were made with an average length of 17 minutes (16.5 h in total) covering a road segment of about 420 m length. Each vehicle is visible for a median duration of 13.6 s."

An insight of HighD can be found in [SCP-CN-001/trajectory_dataset_support](https://github.com/SCP-CN-001/trajectory_dataset_support/blob/main/trajectory_data_analysis/highD.ipynb). For those interested in accessing the complete dataset, please follow this [link](https://www.highd-dataset.com/).

## Argoverse 2

Argoverse 2, curated by Argo AI, is sourced from six prominent U.S. cities, namely Austin, Detroit, Miami, Pittsburgh, Palo Alto, and Washington, D.C. The motion forecasting dataset "encompasses 250,000 scenarios featuring trajectory data" spanning across 10 distinct object types. "Each scenario, lasting 11 seconds, incorporates the 2D, birds-eye-view centroid, and heading information of each tracked object, sampled at 10 Hz." In its entirety, the dataset spans 763 hours and covers a distance of 2110 km.

An insight of Argoverse 2 can be found in [SCP-CN-001/trajectory_dataset_support](https://github.com/SCP-CN-001/trajectory_dataset_support/blob/main/trajectory_data_analysis/Argoverse.ipynb).

## INTERACTION

INTERACTION dataset is collected by University of California, Berkeley. "In the roundabout scenarios, 10479 trajectories of vehicles from five different locations were recorded for around 365 minutes. Similarly, in the unsignalized intersection scenarios, three locations were included and 14867 trajectories were collected for around 433 minutes. In the merging and lane change scenarios, 10933 trajectories were recorded at two locations for around 133 minutes. Finally, one location was selected for the signalized intersection, which provided 3775 trajectories for around 60 minutes."

## NuPlan

NuPlan is the world's first large-scale planning benchmark for autonomous driving. The data is recorded over 4 cities - Boston, Pittsburgh, Singapore and Las Vegas. The nuPlan v1.0 dataset consists of over 15,000 logs and 1300+ hours of driving data. The nuPlan v1.1 dataset brings multiple improvements over the v1.0 dataset. Meanwhile, some log files are removed to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the dataset.

An insight of NuPlan can be found in [SCP-CN-001/trajectory_dataset_support](https://github.com/SCP-CN-001/trajectory_dataset_support/blob/main/trajectory_data_analysis/NuPlan.ipynb). For those interested in the complete dataset, please follow this [link](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuplan#download).

NuPlan also has its own visualizing toolkit package at [nuplan-devkit](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit/tree/master). The documentation of the devkit is [here](https://nuplan-devkit.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/).

[TODO]: Fix the error in parser.

## Waymo Open Dataset v1.2 (WOMD)

Waymo Open Motion Dataset is collected by Waymo from six locations: San Francisco, Phoenix, Mountain View, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Seattle. This dataset has "103,354, 20s 10Hz segments (over 20 million frames)" in v1.2 version, equivalent to approximately 574 hours of rich driving scenarios. Each segment has its own 3D map data.

An insight of WOMD can be found in [SCP-CN-001/trajectory_dataset_support](https://github.com/SCP-CN-001/trajectory_dataset_support/blob/main/trajectory_data_analysis/WOMD.ipynb). For those interested in the complete dataset, please follow this [link](https://waymo.com/open/download/).

[TODO]: In the current map description of WOMD, the lane components are removed. We plan to add a function to detect and construct lanes from the map automatically.
